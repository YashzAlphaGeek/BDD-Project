## Prerequisites

Before running the tests, you need to have the following installed on your system:

1. **Python** (3.7 or higher)
2. **pytest** (7.x.x)
3. **pytest-bdd** (for BDD testing)
4. **pytest plugins** (optional)

## Installation

To set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd bdd_project
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:

        ```bash
        .venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - On macOS/Linux:

        ```bash
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```

5. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

Here is the content of `requirements.txt`:

## Feature and Step Definitions

### Feature File (`devops_pipeline.feature`)

This is a Gherkin feature file that describes the behavior of the CI/CD pipeline integration in the form of scenarios and steps.

```gherkin
Feature: CI/CD Pipeline Integration

  Scenario: Successful deployment in a retail application
    Given Namita configures the CI/CD pipeline with version control integration
    When the code is pushed to the repository
    Then the application should be deployed successfully
```

### Step Definitions (`devops_pipeline_steps.py`)

```gherkin
from pytest_bdd import given, when, then

@given('Namita configures the CI/CD pipeline with version control integration')
def step_impl():
    print("Namita has configured the CI/CD pipeline with version control integration")

@when('the code is pushed to the repository')
def step_impl():
    print("Code has been pushed to the repository")

@then('the application should be deployed successfully')
def step_impl():
    print("Application has been deployed successfully")
```

### Running the Tests

To run the tests with pytest:

- Open a terminal or command prompt.

- Navigate to the project directory.

- Run the tests using the following command:

  pytest -s

## Example Test Output

When you run the tests, if everything is set up correctly, the output will look like this:

Namita has configured the CI/CD pipeline with version control integration
Code has been pushed to the repository
Application has been deployed successfully

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, here are some common solutions:

```gherkin
ModuleNotFoundError: If you see an error like ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tests', make sure your Python environment is set up correctly and that you're running pytest from the root directory of the project.

Step Definitions Not Found: If pytest is unable to find a step definition, ensure that your @given, @when, and @then decorators match the exact step names in your feature files. Also, confirm that your step definitions are correctly imported in the test file.

Missing Dependencies: Ensure that all dependencies are installed by running pip install -r requirements.txt. If issues persist, try reinstalling your environment.
```

This project provides a simple example of how to use BDD with pytest to test the integration of a CI/CD pipeline for a retail application. By using Gherkin syntax for feature files and pytest-bdd for step definition mappings, you can efficiently write and maintain tests that focus on behavior rather than implementation details.
